    About Me!
  </h1>
  
  <br>

<h2>Little Bio</h2>



  <p> I love skateboarding, rock climbing, making stuff, and learning things. I'm VERY stoked about learning software development as it feels much more current and exciting than the Mechanical Engineering coursework I've been doing at university the last three years! I've lived in a van house since I built it back in 2018 and I love it! The idea of remote work allowing me to travel around the US and chase peak climbing weather in world-class climbing destinations is VERY VERY exciting to me! &#127773; </p>

<h2>Michael's 'Historic' Pathway Through Education</h2>

<p> I had a normal public education where I was afraid of most kids, started an ultimate frisbee club, and got a High School diploma. <br> During my Univerity time, I've nimbly hopped between an Environmental degree and a Mechanical Engineering degree and felt an equal lack of satisfaction within both. <br> I'm now 'pivoting' out of college and into Software Development with neither of those Bachelor degrees, BUUUT I did get an Associates in Mathematics which is fun. &#128514;</p>
