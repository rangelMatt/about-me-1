  <h1>About Me!</h1>
  

  <h2>Little Bio</h2>

  <p> I love skateboarding, rock climbing, making stuff, and learning things. I'm VERY enthusiastic about learning software development as it feels much more current and exciting than the Mechanical Engineering coursework I've been doing at university the last three years! I've lived in a van house since I built it back in 2018 and I love it. The idea of remote work allowing me to travel around the US and chase peak climbing weather in world-class climbing destinations is VERY VERY exciting to me! &#127773; </p>
